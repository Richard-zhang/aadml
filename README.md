# Next Step

* implement a visualizer to the dot format to see the computational graph
* use free monad to represent the syntax tree
* use recursion scheme makes more senses here
  * understand how recursion scheme can persist tail recursion properties
* defined the algebra of the term
* take a look at paper connecting recursion schemes and neural networks

* explicit pattern matching
